# Information Modelling & Analysis

Lovnesh Bhardwaj

In a production environment, where we want everything up and running all the time to have the maximum uptime and utilisation of resources to possi- bly process data, make predictions, amongst other things, a buggy class might yield undefined behaviour which might prove to be disasterous for an organi- sation. In order to combat said scenarios, a bug prediction software/classifier would analyse the data surrounding the class/piece of code and make an informed decision on whether to flag the class as buggy or not. Doing so might help prevent possible failure of applications, and therefore, is pivotal to high throughput organisations. To that end, we train different classifiers here to check for the same.
